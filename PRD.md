# Project Requirement Document: Text-to-Speech PWA

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a lightweight Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to convert user-provided text into natural-sounding speech using the Kokoro TTS service. The primary goal is to provide a simple, fast, and accessible tool for generating audio from text directly within a web browser, with PWA capabilities for enhanced user experience.

## 2. Goals

- To provide a user-friendly interface for text input.
- To enable the generation of natural language audio from text using Kokoro TTS.
- To ensure the application is exceptionally lightweight and performs quickly.
- To implement the application as a PWA, allowing for features like offline access and installability.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Text Input Area**: The application must include a multi-line text area (`<textarea>`) where users can type or paste the text they wish to convert to speech. This text area must have a clear, associated label.
- **Generate Button**: A button with the visible text "Generate" must be present to initiate the text-to-speech conversion process.
- **Loading Indicator**: While the text-to-speech generation is in progress:
  - The "Generate" button's text must change to a spinner or similar visual indicator.
  - The "Generate" button must be disabled to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.
- **Audio Output**: Upon successful completion of the text-to-speech process, an audio player element must appear below the "Generate" button. This player will allow the user to listen to the generated audio.
- **UI Spacing**: There must be a noticeable visual separation (slightly larger spacing) between the input area/button section and the audio output area to clearly delineate the input and output sections.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- **Application Type**: Progressive Web Application (PWA).
- **Framework**: Astro.
- **Frontend Library**: React (specifically for building interactive components like the text area, button, and audio player).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Component Library**: Flowbite (utilizing its components and leveraging Tailwind classes).
- **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Kokoro TTS.
- **Kokoro TTS Integration**: Use the `kokoro-js` npm package to interact with the Kokoro TTS service.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The application must be extremely lightweight and optimized for speed, ensuring a quick loading time and responsive user interface given its simple functionality.
- **Responsiveness**: The user interface must be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones) and screen orientations.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to standard web accessibility guidelines (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) where applicable.
- **Offline Capability**: As a PWA, the application should offer basic offline functionality, potentially displaying a custom offline page or message.

## 6. User Flow

1. The user navigates to the application's URL.
2. The PWA loads, presenting a text area with a label and a "Generate" button.
3. The user enters or pastes text into the text area.
4. The user clicks the "Generate" button.
5. The "Generate" button displays a spinner and becomes disabled.
6. The application sends the text to the Kokoro TTS service via the `kokoro-js` library.
7. The application receives the generated audio data.
8. The "Generate" button reverts to its original text ("Generate") and becomes enabled.
9. An audio player element appears below the button, allowing the user to play the generated audio.
10. The user can then play the audio, modify the text, or enter new text to generate more audio.

## 7. User Stories and Expectations

| **User Story** | **Expectations** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| As a user, I want to easily input text for conversion. | I expect a clear text area with a label where I can type or paste text. |
| As a user, I want to convert my text into natural-sounding speech. | I expect a button that initiates the text-to-speech process using Kokoro TTS. |
| As a user, I want feedback while the audio is being generated. | I expect the "Generate" button to show a spinner and become disabled during the generation process. |
| As a user, I want to listen to the generated audio. | I expect an audio player to appear below the button once the audio is ready. |
| As a user, I want the application to feel fast and not weigh down my device. | I expect the application to load quickly and perform smoothly due to its lightweight design. |
| As a user, I want to use the application on my phone, tablet, or computer. | I expect the interface to adapt and look good on different screen sizes and orientations (responsiveness). |
| As a user, I want a basic experience even if I'm temporarily offline. | I expect the PWA to provide some level of functionality or a clear message when offline. |
| As a user, I want the application to be easy to navigate and use. | I expect the interface elements to be clearly labeled and interactive (accessibility). |
