## **Product Requirements Document: AI Natural Voice Generator PWA**

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-04-30

## **1\. Introduction / Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for the AI Natural Voice Generator, a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The application's core purpose is to provide users with a simple and efficient way to convert text input into natural-sounding speech audio using an underlying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool accessible across various devices via modern web browsers.

## **2\. Objectives & Goals**

The primary objectives and goals for the AI Natural Voice Generator PWA are:

* **Goal 1:** Deliver a functional PWA that successfully converts user-provided text into audible speech.  
* **Goal 2:** Ensure the generated audio output is of high, natural-sounding quality, leveraging AI capabilities.  
* **Goal 3:** Provide a simple, intuitive, and seamless user experience for text input, audio generation, playback, and download.  
* **Goal 4:** Develop a reliable application with clear feedback mechanisms for processing states.

## **3\. Target Audience**

* **Primary Users:** General users needing a quick and easy way to convert text into speech.

## **4\. Use Cases**

| User | Behavior | Expected Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| General User | Inputs text into the text area. | The application accepts the text input. |
| General User | Clicks the "Generate" button. | The application initiates the audio generation process. |
| General User | Waits for audio generation to complete. | The application provides feedback on the processing state and presents an audio player upon completion. |
| General User | Plays the audio in the audio player. | The user can hear the generated speech. |
| General User | Clicks the "Download" button. | The application downloads the audio file. |

## **5\. Key Features (MVP)**

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following core features:

| Feature | Description | Expected Behavior |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| FE-1: Text Input | A dedicated text area (\`\`) where users can type or paste the text they want to convert. | The text area allows users to input text. |
| FE-2: Audio Generation Trigger | A primary button (\`\`) for users to initiate the text-to-speech conversion process. | The button triggers the audio generation. |
| FE-3: Processing Feedback | Visual indication that audio generation is in progress. | The application displays a loading indicator, disables the generate button, and changes the button text. |
| FE-4: Process Completion Feedback | Indication that audio generation is complete. | The generate button reverts to its original state. |
| FE-5: Audio Playback | An HTML5 audio player for playing the generated speech. | The user can play, pause, and control the volume of the generated audio. |
| FE-6: Audio Download | A button to download the generated audio file. | The user can download the audio file. |

## **6\. User Stories**

| ID | User Story |
| :---- | :---- |
| US-1 | As a user, I want to input text into a text area so that I can specify the content I want converted to audio. |
| US-2 | As a user, I want to click a button to start the audio generation process so that the system begins converting my text. |
| US-3 | As a user, I want to see a clear indication (like a loading spinner and disabled button) when the audio is being generated so that I know the system is working and I don't click the button again. |
| US-4 | As a user, I want the generation button to return to its normal state after processing finishes so that I know I can generate new audio. |
| US-5 | As a user, I want to see an audio player appear with my generated speech after the process is complete so that I can listen to it directly within the app. |
| US-6 | As a user, I want to be able to download the generated audio file so that I can save it and use it elsewhere. |

## **7\. Design & UI/UX Considerations**

* The interface should be clean, minimal, and focused on the core task.  
* Clear visual hierarchy: Text area \-\> Generate button \-\> Audio Player \-\> Download button.  
* Loading states must be obvious to prevent user confusion.  
* Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements (buttons, player) for usability.  
* The application should be responsive and work well on various screen sizes (desktop, mobile).

## **8\. Technical Requirements**

* **TR-1: Platform:** Must be developed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) installable on compatible devices/browsers. The application will use the Astro framework and React.  
* **TR-2: Core Technology:** Utilize standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). Tailwindcss will be used for styling and Flowbite as the component library.  
* **TR-3: AI Text-to-Speech Engine:** Must integrate with an AI-based TTS service/API to generate natural-sounding voice. kokoro-js will be used for text-to-speech conversion.  
* **TR-4: Audio Output:** The application must receive the generated audio from the TTS engine and make it available to the user.  
* **TR-5: Download Functionality:** Implement a client-side mechanism to allow users to download the generated audio file with a meaningful filename.  
* **TR-6: Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling (e.g., display a message if the TTS generation fails).

## **9\. Future Considerations / Out of Scope for MVP**

* Voice selection (different genders, accents, styles).  
* Language selection.  
* Ability to control speech parameters (speed, pitch).  
* Handling very long texts (e.g., background processing).  
* Advanced error reporting.  
* Monitor and visualization dashboard.
