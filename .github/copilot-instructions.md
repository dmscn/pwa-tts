# GitHub Copilot Instructions for AI Natural Voice Generator

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
You're assisting with the development of a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that converts user-input text into high-quality, natural-sounding speech using an AI-powered Text-to-Speech engine. The app will be built using Astro + React with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite for styling. The TTS functionality will be powered by the `kokoro-js` library.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

- Use **Astro** for routing and project structure.
- Embed **React components** for interactive sections (e.g., audio generator).
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling, in combination with **Flowbite** UI components.
- Ensure **PWA compatibility** using Astro PWA integration.

## âœ… Core Features to Implement (MVP)

| Feature             | Details |
|---------------------|---------|
| `TextInput`         | A React component for entering text to convert. Use `<textarea>` styled with Tailwind. |
| `GenerateButton`    | A button component that triggers the audio generation via `kokoro-js`. |
| `LoadingIndicator`  | Show spinner and disable button during TTS processing. |
| `AudioPlayer`       | Standard HTML5 audio player to play the generated audio. |
| `DownloadButton`    | Client-side logic to allow downloading the audio file with a meaningful filename. |
| `ErrorHandling`     | Display basic error messages (e.g., failed TTS request). |

---

## ðŸ§  Functional Logic

- When user clicks **"Generate"**, call `kokoro-js` to convert text to speech.
- Show loading feedback until response is received.
- Upon success, render the audio player with the generated audio.
- Provide an option to download the audio.
- Handle errors with clear messages (use `try/catch` and `Toast` if available from Flowbite).

---

## ðŸ§ª UX/UI Guidelines

- Clean, minimal UI.
- Focused user flow: `Text âžœ Generate âžœ Playback âžœ Download`.
- Use accessible components and responsive design (desktop & mobile).
- Ensure good spacing between elements.

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- Use **Astro pages** for layout and routing.
- Place **React components** in `src/components/` directory.
- Keep styles **Tailwind-first**, avoid unnecessary CSS.
- Implement **client-side download** using `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL`.
- Use proper **file naming** for downloaded files (e.g., `tts-output-<timestamp>.mp3`).

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Framework: `Astro + React`
- Styling: `Tailwind CSS + Flowbite`
- TTS Engine: `kokoro-js`
- Target: `PWA`, installable on desktop and mobile

---

## ðŸš« Out of Scope (MVP)

Do **not** include:
- Voice/language/accent selection
- Speech speed/pitch controls
- Authentication
- Backend services
- Background processing for long texts

---

## ðŸ§¹ Code Style

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Prefer functional React components
- Keep components modular and single-purpose
- Write accessible and semantic HTML
